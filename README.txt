-- Continuous Delivery without Significant Test Automation --

All organisations aspiring agile don’t have a significant level of automated checks available. Deciding to start adding automation on top of legacy code is a long road to travel and while on route, releases will rely on more manual testing. Meanwhile, automating builds to a single click deploy already enables delivering. 

This talk tells a story of going into mindset of continuous delivery of continuous releases to production without the level of test automation often seen as a key practice. You will learn from the changes we went through moving from monthly (scrum) to continuous (kanban) releases as we started delivering value in production in small incremental changes. The talk will help you see one route to a happy agile team with satisfied customers, where the recipe is built more around collaboration and smart exploratory testing than test automation to deliver a steady stream value.
